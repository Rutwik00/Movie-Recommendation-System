## Introduction

This Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning project designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. By analyzing user preferences and movie characteristics, the system offers tailored recommendations to enhance the movie-watching experience.

## Features

- **Rating System**: Rate movies to improve future recommendations.
- **Movie Discovery**: Explore new films that align with your tastes.
- **User Profiles**: Create and manage your profile to get more accurate suggestions.

## Algorithms

The recommendation system employs the following algorithms:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: 
   - Analyzes user behavior and preferences to make recommendations.
   - Identifies similar users and suggests movies they enjoyed.

2. **Content-Based Filtering**:
   - Recommends movies based on their features (genre, actors, directors).
   - Suggests films similar to those you've previously enjoyed.

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
   - Leverages the strengths of both methods to provide diverse suggestions.

These algorithms work together to provide a robust and accurate movie recommendation experience.
